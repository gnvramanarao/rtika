>Apache Tika is a content detection and analysis framework, written in Java, stewarded at the Apache Software Foundation. It detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types, and as well as providing a Java library, has server and command-line editions suitable for use from other programming languages ...

>For most of the more common and popular formats, Tika then provides content extraction, metadata extraction and language identification capabilities. (From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tika>, accessed Jan 18, 2018)

This is an R interface to the Tika software. 

## Installation
To start, you need R and `Java 8` or `OpenJDK 1.8`. Higher versions work. To check your version, run the command `java -version` from a terminal. 
Get Java installation tips at <https://www.java.com/en/download/> or <http://openjdk.java.net/install/>. 
Because the `rJava` package is ***not*** required, installation is simple. You can cut and paste the following snippet:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('rtika', repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org')

library('rtika')

# You need to install the Apache Tika .jar once.
install_tika()

```

## Key Features

* `tika_text()` to extract plain text.
* `tika_xml()` and `tika_html()` to get a structured XHMTL rendition.
* `tika_json()` to get metadata as `.json`, with XHMTL content. 
* `tika_json_text()` to get metadata as `.json`, with plain text content.
* `tika()` is the main function the others above inherit from. 
* `tika_fetch()` to download files with a file extension matching the Content-Type.

## Supported File Types

Tika parses and extracts text or metadata from over one thousand digital formats, including:

* Portable Document Format (`.pdf`)
* Microsoft Office document formats (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.)
* Rich Text Format (`.rtf`)
* Electronic Publication Format (`.epub`)
* Image formats (`.jpeg`, `.png`, etc.)
* Mail formats (`.mbox`, Outlook)
* HyperText Markup Language (`.html`)
* XML and derived formats (`.xml`, etc.)
* Compression and packaging formats (`.gzip`, `.rar`, etc.)
* OpenDocument Format
* iWorks document formats
* WordPerfect document formats
* Text formats
* Feed and Syndication formats
* Help formats
* Audio formats
* Video formats
* Java class files and archives
* Source code
* CAD formats
* Font formats
* Scientific formats
* Executable programs and libraries
* Crypto formats

## Get Plain Text

**The `rtika` package processes batches of documents efficiently**, so I recommend batches. 
Currently, the `tika()` parsers take a tiny bit of time to spin up, and that will get annoying with hundreds of separate calls to the functions.
```{r}
# Test files
batch <- c(
  system.file("extdata", "jsonlite.pdf", package = "rtika"),
  system.file("extdata", "curl.pdf", package = "rtika"),
  system.file("extdata", "table.docx", package = "rtika"),
  system.file("extdata", "xml2.pdf", package = "rtika"),
  system.file("extdata", "R-FAQ.html", package = "rtika"),
  system.file("extdata", "calculator.jpg", package = "rtika"),
  system.file("extdata", "tika.apache.org.zip", package = "rtika")
)

# batches are best, and can also be piped with magrittr.
text <- tika_text(batch)

# text has one string for each document:
length(text)

# A snippet:
cat(substr(text[1], 54, 190)) 

```

## Enhancements

Tika also integrates with the Tesseract OCR program, which extracts plain text from images of text. If Tesseract is installed, Tika will automatically use it for images and PDFs that contain images of text. To get that working, follow the [Tesseract installation instructions](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki). The next time Tika is run, it  should detect Tesseract. Alternately, you may try the [`tesseract`](https://github.com/ropensci/tesseract) package by @jeroen, which is a R interface to the required program and has several installation methods.

The Apache Tika community welcomes your feedback. Issues regarding the R interface should be raised at the [`rTika` Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ropensci/tesseract). If you are confident the issue concerns Tika or one of its underlying parsers, use the [Tika Bugtracking System](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TIKA/issues). 

## Using the Tika App Directly

If your project or package needs to use the Tika App `.jar`, you can include `rTika` as a dependency and call the `rtika::tika_jar()` function to get the path to the Tika app installed on the system. 


## Similar R Packages

The [`pdftools`](https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools) package extracts metadata and text from PDF files, the [`antiword`](https://github.com/ropensci/antiword) package extracts text from recent versions of Word, and the [`epubr`](https://github.com/ropensci/epubr) package by @leonawicz processes `epub` files. These do not depend on Java. Listing all of the similar packages would be an undertaking, since Apache Tika processes over a thousand file types. 

The big difference between Tika and a specialized parser is that Tika integrates dozens of specialist libraries maintained by the Apache Foundation. While Tika's unified approach offers a bit less control, it eases the processing of digital archives that contain unpredictable files. 

For example, researchers use Tika to process archives from court cases, governments, or the Internet Archive that span multiple years. These archives frequently contain diverse formats and multiple versions of each format. Because Tika finds the matching parser for each file, is well suited to diverse documents. In general, the parsing quality is very good and consistently so. In contrast, certain specialized parsers only work with a particular version of a file, and require more tinkering. 

On the other hand, a specialized library may offer certain advantages when it comes to structured data and formatting. For example, the [`tabulizer`](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer) package by @leeper and @tpaskhalis includes bindings to the 'Tabula PDF Table Extractor Library'. Because PDF files store tables as a series of positions with no clear boundaries between data cells, extracting a `data.frame` or `matrix` requires heuristics and customization. In the case of extracting tables, Tika is a bit less useful for PDFs and extracts plain text with various whitespaces between cells and new lines between rows. While it produces plain from this format, this is not always the case. Tika is still quite powerful and in fact there are formats where `rtika` will extract table-like XML. For example, with Word documents, Tika extracts XHTML that can be turned into a tabular `data.frame` using the `rvest::html_table()` function. 

## History

In September 2017, github.com user *kyusque* released `tikaR`, which uses the `rJava` package to interact with Tika (See: <https://github.com/kyusque/tikaR>). 
As of writing, it provided similar text and metadata extraction, but only `xml` output. 

Back in March 2012, I started a similar project to interface with Apache Tika.
My code also used low-level functions from the `rJava` package.
I halted development after discovering that the Tika command line interface (CLI) was easier to use.
My empty repository is at <https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/r-tika/>.

I chose to finally develop this package after getting excited by Tika's new 'batch processor' module, written in Java.
The batch processor has very good efficiency when processing tens of thousands of documents. 
Further, it is not too slow for a single document either, and handles errors gracefully. 
Connecting `R` to the Tika batch processor turned out to be relatively simple, because the `R` code is simple.
It uses the CLI to point Tika to the files. Simplicity, along with continuous testing, should ease integration.
I anticipate that some researchers will need plain text output, while others will want `json` output.
Some will want multiple processing threads to speed things up.
These features are now implemented in `rtika`, although apparently not in `tikaR` yet.
